          <p>I enjoy watching sports, being active, and traveling. I am  a lifelong Packer fan but also like to follow Badger football, Badger basketball, and Yankee baseball. Apline skiing, tennis, running, and hiking are my favorite ways to stay active. Countries I have visited include China, South Africa, Mozambique, Switzerland, Spain, Finland, Belize, Costa Rica, Galapagos, and Tahiti.</p>

          For better or for worse, I am a <a href=https://www.usenix.org/system/files/1311_05-08_mickens.pdf>systems programmer</a>.

          <p><i>"I'm personally convinced that computer science has a lot in common with physics. Both are about how the world works at a rather fundamental level. The difference, of course, is that while in physics you're supposed to figure out how the world is made up, in computer science you create the world. Within the confines of the computer, you're the creator. You get to ultimately control everything that happens. If you're good enough, you can be God. On a small scale." ~Linus Torvalds </i></p>
          <p><i>"Nobody should start to undertake a large project. You start with a small trivial project, and you should never expect it to get large. If you do, you'll just overdesign and generally think it is more important than it likely is at that stage. Or worse, you might be scared away by the sheer size of the work you envision. So start small, and think about the details. Don't think about some big picture and fancy design. If it doesn't solve some fairly immediate need, it's almost certainly over-designed. And don't expect people to jump in and help you. That's not how these things work. You need to get something half-way useful first, and then others will say 'hey, that almost works for me', and they will get involved in the project." ~Linus Torvalds</i></p>
